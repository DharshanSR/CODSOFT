Java Projects Repository 🚀
Welcome to this vibrant repository containing three distinct Java projects designed to showcase a variety of programming skills and concepts! Whether you're a beginner looking to get your hands dirty with some practical Java applications or a Begineer developer aiming to brush up on certain concepts, you've come to the right place. Dive into the fascinating world of a Number Guessing Game 🎲, an ATM Machine simulation 💳, and a Student Marks Calculator 📚. Each project offers a unique interactive experience and a chance to explore different facets of Java programming.

Number Guessing Game 🎲
Dive into the Number Guessing Game, a console-based Java application that challenges you to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and number of attempts. 

ATM Machine 💳
