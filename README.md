# Java Projects: Number Guessing Game, ATM Machine, and Student Marks Calculator

This repository contains three separate Java projects, each designed to demonstrate different programming concepts and skills. The projects include a Number Guessing Game, an ATM Machine simulation, and a Student Marks Calculator. Each project is standalone and provides a unique interactive experience.

## Projects Overview

### Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a console-based Java application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and number of attempts. It demonstrates basic Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

### ATM Machine

The ATM Machine simulation is a more complex Java application that mimics the basic functionalities of an ATM, including account login, balance checking, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles, file handling, and exception handling in Java.

### Student Marks Calculator

The Student Marks Calculator is a Java application designed to calculate and manage students' grades. It allows for the addition of student marks, calculation of total marks, and determination of grades based on predefined criteria. This project illustrates data management and manipulation in Java.
